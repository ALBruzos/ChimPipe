ChimPipe Documentation
======================

ChimPipe is a computational method for the detection of novel transcription-induced chimeric transcripts and fusion genes from Illumina Paired-End RNA-seq data. It combines junction spanning and paired-end read information to accurately detect chimeric splice junctions at base-pair resolution. ChimPipe have been developed at the `Computational Biology of RNA Processing group`_ in Barcelona, Spain.

ChimPipe source code is freely available in our `GitHub repository`_.
