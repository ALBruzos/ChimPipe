Biological importance of chimeras
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chimeras are transcripts whose sequence is encoded in two or more different genes. The study of these kind of transcripts is very relevant in two different context:

* **Genome biology**. Understanding how the information is encoded in the genome is one of the challenges of biology. In the last yeast, an increasingly number of chimeric transcripts have been reported in non cancer samples from different species. Although their function and the mechanism through they arise are not well know, their existence could reveal new dimensions in how information is encoded in the genome. As, the combination of sequences from different genes could be a way of increasing the information content of the genomes. Several transcriptional event have been proposed to explain how this transcripts could arise:

	* **Trans-splicing**. Splicing between two pre-mRNAs from different genes producing a chimera. 
	
	* **Readthrough or conjoined transcription**. Combined transcription of two consecutive genes on the same chromosome and strand. Typically, such chimera begin at the promoter of the upstream gene and end at the termination point of the downstream gene.
	
	* **SHS-transcriptional slippage**. Pairing of short homologous sequences (SHS) among two different transcripts that leads to a recombination producing a chimeric transcript. 

* **Cancer genomics**. It is very well know that the generation of fusion genes through chromosomic rearrangements is a major driver in certain types of cancer. These are hydrid genes formed from two previously separate genes that encode altered proteins with abnormal activity. Thus, the identification and study of chimeric transcripts in cancer can serve to detect such alterations in cancer and in last term to the detection of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.
