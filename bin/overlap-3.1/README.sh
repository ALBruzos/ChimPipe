Dear Sarah,

in this dir:

/users/rg/dkedra/soft/bin

you will find the new version of the ocaml. In case you need to look at the build directory:
 /users/rg/dkedra/soft/tmp/OCAML/ocaml-4.00.1

I used the standard steps from INSTALL with loogging the compilation steps in:
log.bootstrap
log.opt
log.world

Thanks a lot for looking into it

the idea is to recompile overlap with the new ocaml version and try it again
to see if it is much faster than before or not
